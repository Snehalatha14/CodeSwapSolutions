# CodeSwapSolutions - Front-End Development Project

## Project Overview

As a Front-End Development Intern at CodeSwapSolutions, I worked on developing a single platform for multiple activities aimed at enhancing user convenience and productivity. The project involved building responsive front-end solutions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on improving the user experience and engagement.

## Key Features

This platform integrates eight web applications into a single interface:
- **Sci-Calculator**: A fully functional scientific calculator.
- **File Uploader**: An easy-to-use file upload tool.
- **News**: Displays real-time news from various categories.
- **Music**: A music player with intuitive controls.
- **Stopwatch**: A stopwatch with start, pause, and reset functionalities.
- **Unit Converter**: A tool for converting units between various measurements.
- **Drawing Application**: A simple and intuitive canvas-based drawing tool that allows users to create digital drawings using various brush types and colors.
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**: An interactive game where users can play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer with a simple interface and immediate results.

Each of these applications is accessible via a user-friendly interface, offering a seamless and interactive experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: To ensure the responsiveness of the platform and to enhance the visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and functionality to the web applications, including the Drawing Application and Rock-Paper-Scissors Game.
